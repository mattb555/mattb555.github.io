      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while (again). I could give a long, winding story about why this site went dark for 30&amp;rsquo;ish months (again), but instead I&amp;rsquo;ll just take the opportunity to inform everyone that I&amp;rsquo;ve no longer been working at Tesla since May 2024. I loved the team I was on and it was a lot of fun.
Ok joke about the previous post on this site aside, I am legitimately currently looking for new opportunities.</description>

      <title>Damocles: Casing Woes</title>

      <description>I wrapped up a long running refactor of my online board game Damocles today with a deployment to Heroku. I want to focus this post on a pain point I ran into while doing this related to casing.
The purpose behind the refactor was to break up a monolithic file containing almost every React based piece of the project into separate files for all the React components. Part of this involved renaming some of the existing files, as I wanted to go from lowercase to PascalCase (ie, damoclesgame to DamoclesGame).</description>
