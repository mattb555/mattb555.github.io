      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while (again). I could give a long, winding story about why this site went dark for 30&amp;rsquo;ish months (again), but instead I&amp;rsquo;ll just take the opportunity to inform everyone that I&amp;rsquo;ve no longer been working at Tesla since May 2024. I loved the team I was on and it was a lot of fun.
Ok joke about the previous post on this site aside, I am legitimately currently looking for new opportunities.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. I could give a long, winding story about why this site went dark for 18&amp;rsquo;ish months, but instead I&amp;rsquo;ll just take the opportunity to inform everyone that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at Tesla since March 2021. I love the team I&amp;rsquo;m on and it&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of fun. There are also a lot of things they don&amp;rsquo;t want me talking about so that&amp;rsquo;s the last I&amp;rsquo;m going to say on that topic, for the time being.</description>
