      <description>Today I wrapped up some outstanding issues related to the site relating to the DNS and Domain Host. In particular, I transferred the matthewbunge.com domain from GoDaddy, where I had held it for 7 years, to Namecheap. The primary motiviation was financial: the running costs of the website were reduced by approximately 55% annually. In practice, this is like 12 bucks, but saved money for no real cost is still saved money.</description>

      <description>My original website is years old at this point and kind of a mess, so I decided to make a new one. This time around I decided to harness the power of a static site generator. After trying a couple out, I decided to go with Hugo. I want my personal site to be more of a personal blog and I think Hugo is extremely adept at handling that use case.</description>
