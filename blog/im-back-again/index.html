    <p>Well, it&rsquo;s been a while (again). I could give a long, winding story about why this site went dark for 30&rsquo;ish months (again), but instead I&rsquo;ll just take the opportunity to inform everyone that I&rsquo;ve no longer been working at Tesla since May 2024. I loved the team I was on and it was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Ok joke about the previous post on this site aside, I am legitimately currently looking for new opportunities. After leaving Tesla I took a long and well-deserved vacation, which was then immediately followed by a long and potentially less deserved bout of sickness that I have finally recovered from. Since I am back to near 100%, I am going to start shifting my resources from leisure and personal development to professional and career development, and to that extent I will be ramping up usage of this website in the coming weeks (again).</p>
<p>In the meantime, here are a few house cleaning notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated my contact email. The old gmail is completely overrun with spam, so I&rsquo;ve shifted to using my personal site with a variety of addresses to figure out how spammers are finding me out. I&rsquo;m sorry if you&rsquo;ve contacted me there lately and I&rsquo;ve missed you, hopefully this new setup will go much better.</li>
<li>Removed the dead link to Damocles. It pretty much died when Heroku dropped the free plan. Damocles was a fun time at the time but the actual inventor of the game has no interest in it in 2024 so it isn&rsquo;t really worth any further development time on my part.</li>
</ul>
