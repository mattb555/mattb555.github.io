      <description>I just wrapped up reconfiguring Damocles to use Bootstrap and layout-wise I am extremely happy with the result. The Bootstrap integration with React is excellent and intuitive and I look forward to doing more with it. The next step is going to involve getting some more labels put up and otherwise reworking a bunch of fixed strings so it&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to wait long.
In other news, I decided to treat myself and I went and bought a number of JetBrains tools, including their web development IDE &amp;ldquo;WebStorm&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Damocles: Casing Woes</title>

      <description>I wrapped up a long running refactor of my online board game Damocles today with a deployment to Heroku. I want to focus this post on a pain point I ran into while doing this related to casing.
The purpose behind the refactor was to break up a monolithic file containing almost every React based piece of the project into separate files for all the React components. Part of this involved renaming some of the existing files, as I wanted to go from lowercase to PascalCase (ie, damoclesgame to DamoclesGame).</description>

      <title>Personal Site: New Site Pt. 2</title>

      <description>Today I wrapped up some outstanding issues related to the site relating to the DNS and Domain Host. In particular, I transferred the matthewbunge.com domain from GoDaddy, where I had held it for 7 years, to Namecheap. The primary motiviation was financial: the running costs of the website were reduced by approximately 55% annually. In practice, this is like 12 bucks, but saved money for no real cost is still saved money.</description>

      <description>My original website is years old at this point and kind of a mess, so I decided to make a new one. This time around I decided to harness the power of a static site generator. After trying a couple out, I decided to go with Hugo. I want my personal site to be more of a personal blog and I think Hugo is extremely adept at handling that use case.</description>
