The primary motiviation was financial: the running costs of the website were reduced by approximately 55% annually. In practice, this is like 12 bucks, but saved money for no real cost is still saved money." />

    <p>Today I wrapped up some outstanding issues related to the site relating to the DNS and Domain Host. In particular, I transferred the matthewbunge.com domain from GoDaddy, where I had held it for 7 years, to Namecheap. The primary motiviation was financial: the running costs of the website were reduced by approximately 55% annually. In practice, this is like 12 bucks, but saved money for no real cost is still saved money.</p>
<p>A friend of mine reports that he continues to have problems accessing the site from his phone, but he thinks that might be his own fault. I&rsquo;ve told him to look into it more but knowing him, he won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>For the purposes of my TODO list, this website project is wrapped up for now. Developing a new Hugo theme for it can go on the TODO list, but it&rsquo;s low priority compared to other things I have going on currently.</p>
