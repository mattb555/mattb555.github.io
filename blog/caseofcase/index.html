    <p>I wrapped up a long running refactor of my online board game Damocles today with a deployment to Heroku. I want to focus this post on a pain point I ran into while doing this related to casing.</p>
<p>The purpose behind the refactor was to break up a monolithic file containing almost every React based piece of the project into separate files for all the React components. Part of this involved renaming some of the existing files, as I wanted to go from lowercase to PascalCase (ie, damoclesgame to DamoclesGame). The details of what went wrong aren&rsquo;t really as interesting as the lessons learned, so I&rsquo;m moving straight ahead to that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing case of existing files in git will not register as a change without the command: <code>git mv casedfile.js CasedFile.js</code></li>
<li>Node on Heroku needs exact file casing or else everything breaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good lessons to learn, and as of now Damocles is back up and playable (as much as it ever was). I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and add it to my front page here for anyone interested (though you&rsquo;re going to need a friend).</p>
