<meta property="og:description" content="I just wrapped up reconfiguring Damocles to use Bootstrap and layout-wise I am extremely happy with the result. The Bootstrap integration with React is excellent and intuitive and I look forward to doing more with it. The next step is going to involve getting some more labels put up and otherwise reworking a bunch of fixed strings so it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m going to need to wait long.
In other news, I decided to treat myself and I went and bought a number of JetBrains tools, including their web development IDE &ldquo;WebStorm&rdquo;." />

    <p>I just wrapped up reconfiguring Damocles to use Bootstrap and layout-wise I am extremely happy with the result. The Bootstrap integration with React is excellent and intuitive and I look forward to doing more with it. The next step is going to involve getting some more labels put up and otherwise reworking a bunch of fixed strings so it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m going to need to wait long.</p>
<p>In other news, I decided to treat myself and I went and bought a number of JetBrains tools, including their web development IDE &ldquo;WebStorm&rdquo;. Up until now I&rsquo;ve been working on Damocles in VSCode, and while I continue to like the lightness of that program, WebStorm in a short amount of time has already won me over, not only in regards to React-Bootstrap, but just JS in general. It caught a lot that VSCode wasn&rsquo;t even considering and I think going forward it&rsquo;s going to be my tool of choice for this project.</p>
